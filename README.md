# Equation Calculator Python
This is a simple CLI application which can solve Linear and Quadratic equations, using the coefficients provided by the user's input via keyboard. It displays the equation and its roots.
When solving for quadratic equations, it considers whether the discriminant is negative, positive, or zero, and shows results accordingly, considering complex roots.
Input is validated all the way. No "while true" loops were used.
